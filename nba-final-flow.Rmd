## Project Introduction 👋🏽

Inspired by @PmInspiration, this blog will use R to explore process mining on a subject I'm fond of - basketball 🏀😍. I've played basketball all my life, although my failing left knee means I play infrequently in my older age. I'll be analysing game 5 of the 2024 NBA final between Luka's Dallas Mavericks and Jayson's Boston Celtics. Well done Celtics 🍀, who last won a championship 16 years ago. I'll avoid findings which could just as easily be found in a games summary statistics and focus on what unique insights process mining provides. Let's start with the data.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(bupaverse)
library(patchwork)

# Get data
nba_2024_g5_pm_data <- read_csv("./Data/nba-final-2024-game-5.csv", col_names = TRUE)

```

## Data Treatment 🧪

The data collation was a manual effort, a labour of love. After watching game 5 of the 2024 NBA finals I painstakingly noted down each activity along with the timestamp. To add assurance to this data set I checked each activity available on [@nba.com/play-by-play](https://www.nba.com/game/dal-vs-bos-0042300405/play-by-play?period=All){.uri} matched on timestamp and cross checked the summary player stats against [@nba.com/box-score](https://www.nba.com/game/dal-vs-bos-0042300405/box-score?period=All){.uri}.

A few self imposed rules during data creation:
-   To define the process under analysis, one end to end run or "case" ends with a shot 
-   Unless specified from the nba website I've timestamped at the beginning of each activity

## Create Eventlog ⏳

```{r}

nba_final_g5_eventlog <-  nba_2024_g5_pm_data %>% 
 mutate(lifecycle_id = "complete", 
        timestamp = ymd_hms(paste0("20240617 ", timestamp))) %>% 
 eventlog(case_id = "case_id", 
          activity_id = "activity_id", 
          activity_instance_id = "seq", 
          lifecycle_id = "lifecycle_id", 
          timestamp = "timestamp", 
          resource_id = "resource_id", 
          order = "seq", 
          validate = TRUE)

```

## Analysis 🔬 {.tabset} 

### Control-Flow

Control flow in process mining refers to the sequence and decision points of activities within a business process.

```{r}

shot_made_plot <- nba_final_g5_eventlog %>%
 filter_activity_presence("shot-make") %>%
 group_by(teams_play) %>%
 trace_length("log") %>%
 plot() +
 labs(title = "Teams Traces by Shot Made")


shot_miss_plot <- nba_final_g5_eventlog %>%
 filter_activity_presence("shot-miss") %>%
 group_by(teams_play) %>%
 trace_length("log") %>%
 plot() +
 labs(title = "Teams Traces by Shot Miss")

shot_made_plot + shot_miss_plot

```

### Performance

```{r}

### Organisational

```{r}

### Multi-dimensional

```{r}

```

## Conclusion 🎁


Improvements

Automate data collection
Have all 5 games in the data set
Have included, as an activity, when players don't move with the ball. This would have been interesting to delve into. I suspect you would see the time Boston Celtics held the ball increase in quarter 4 as they attempt to run the clock.

## Reproducibility 🔂

I attempt to make a habit of coding functionally and with reproducibility in mind. However, for this project I only needed the final 5 games of the 2024 NBA final. As such, for those wanting to reuse code to scrape other games, please check: - List names for object `roster_html` - In code chunk `transform_roster_data` the team names have been manually added
